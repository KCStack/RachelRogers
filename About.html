    <p>Growing up, I was an active, but chunky, kid. My parents were amazed with my activity level and saw no issues with my diet. What they didn’t see were the snacks that I would sneak, the soda that I consumed, and the hidden stash of goodies that
      made me feel good. As I became an adult, my activity level and energy decreased, and along with it my health hit rock bottom and my waist line rapidly increased.</p><br>

    <p>I was tired. I was done with "feeding up" to feel good. I wanted to smile and mean it. I wanted to enjoy my childrens' childhood instead of being so worn out all the time that I was missing it. In January of 2019, I was so done with watching
      life pass me by,
      that I became determined to figure out why no matter what I tried, I could never could keep up with a “diet”. Why couldn’t I be the fit, healthy, happy girl my heart was yearning for?!</p><br>

    <p>I began doing scientific research on diets. I was tired of the false promises of weight loss products that multi-level marketing offered, as well as the fad diets and the crazy juice ideas. I wanted long term success without baratic surgery.
      What did they do to make sure the surgery worked? Why do people who lose a ton of a weight find it back so quickly? What could I do to have a before and after picture that was jaw dropping?</p><br>

    <p>Once I came up with a game plan, I made sure I surrounded myself with people that would either cheer me on or would work with me to find success. My offical plan of action started February 25, 2019. By May of 2019 I was unstoppable. I was
      determined that I was going to be successful and that anyone that wanted their own cheerleader, a long term friend, or even a stranger to help them in their own weight loss journey, I was going to be their person! So, in December 2019, I
      received my certification as a nutrition health coach. </p><br>

    <p>As of today I have lost a total of 185lbs. I wake up excited for my day. Together, let's not just get skinny, lets get healthy! Let's still enjoy food, but also enjoy that there's more to live for than just food! Feel free to <a
        href="Contact.html"><u>contact me</u></a> either via social media platform or through email. Take at look at my <a href="plansassist.html"><u>pricing</u></a> for meal plans. I <strong>never</strong> charge to be a cheerleader or for guidance.
